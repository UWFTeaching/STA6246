## Battery Life Experiment

-   An experimenter wanted to study the life of a battery in a the design phase.

-   The engineer deicides to test a=3 plate materials and b=3 temperature (15, 75, and 125) degrees F.

-   n=4 batteries were used

-   N=abn = 36

### Data description

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)

Lifebattery=c(130,155,74,180,150,188,126,159,138,110,168,160,34,40,75,80,136,122,106,115,174,120,150,139,82,20,70,58,25,70,58,45,96,104,60,82)

MaterialType= gl(n = 3,k=4,length = 36,labels = (1:3))

Temp= gl(n = 3,k=12,length = 36,labels = c(15,70,125))

battery_data =tibble(Lifebattery,MaterialType,Temp)

## Plotting

interaction.plot(x.factor = Temp,trace.factor = MaterialType,response = Lifebattery,fun = mean)

head(battery_data)

battery_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Temp,y=Lifebattery,group=Temp)) +
  geom_point()+
  stat_summary(aes(group=1),
               fun = mean, 
               geom = "line", 
               col="red",
               linewidth=2)+
  stat_summary(aes(label=round(..y..,1),group=1),
               fun = mean, 
               geom = "text", 
               col="blue",
               size=10)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Temp",
       y="Battery Life (in hours)")+
  facet_wrap(~MaterialType)

battery_data %>% 
  select(Lifebattery,Temp) %>%
  tbl_summary(by=Temp,
              statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"))
```

-   The mean battery life is reduced when the temperature increases for all 3 material types.

-   add more comments

### ANOVA in R

##### Fitting

```{r}
library(sjPlot)

# ANOVA one factor and one blocking factor
results=aov(Lifebattery~ MaterialType *Temp)
summary(results)


```

```{r}

# Individual CIs 
confint(results)
```

-   There was a significance **main** effect of the temperature on the battery life (p=0.00198)

-   There was a significance **main** effect of the Material Type on the battery life (p\<0.001)

-   There was a significance **interaction** effect of the temperature and Material Type on the battery life (p=0.0186)

##### Model Adequacy

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(results)
```

No transformation is needed.

##### Multiple Comparison

Considering 5% level of significance.

```{r}
#Tukey Test 
THSD=TukeyHSD(results,which = "MaterialType")
plot(THSD,las=1)
THSD
# Fisher LSD Test
library(agricolae)
L=LSD.test(results,"MaterialType",console=TRUE,group = F)
```

**Conclusion**:

-   Tukey's Test indicates:

    -   Significant differences between:

        -   all temperatures

        -   Material Type 1 and 3

-   Fisher LSD Test indicates:

    -   Significant differences between:

        -   all temperatures

        -   Material Type 1 and 3

        -   Material Type 1 and 2

The material 3 seems to be robust to higher and lower temperature.

The material 2 seems to be better fitted to lower temperature.

## Impurity data (One cell observation)

```{r}
library(additivityTests)

impurity=c(5,3,1,4,1,1,6,4,3,3,2,1,5,3,2)

Press= gl(n = 5,k=3,length = 15,labels = seq(25,45,5))

Temp= gl(n = 3,k=1,length = 15,labels = c(100,125,150))

data=matrix(impurity,nrow = 3)

# additivity Test (no-interaction)
tukey.test(data)


av=aov(impurity ~ Press + Temp)
summary(av)
```



## 
Radar Scope detection

2 factors: 3x2 factorial design.

An engineer is studying methods for improving the ability to detect targets on a radar scope.

Two factors she considers to be important are the amount of background **noise**, or "ground clutter," on the scope and the type of **filter** placed over the screen.

An experiment is designed using **three levels** of ground clutter and **two filter types**.

We will consider these as fixed‐type factors.

The experiment is performed by randomly selecting a treatment combination (ground clutter level and filter type) and then introducing a signal representing the target into the scope.

The **intensity** of this target is increased until the operator observes it.

The intensity level at detection is then measured as the response variable.

**Blocking**

Because of operator availability, it is convenient to select an operator and keep him or her at the scope until all the necessary runs have been made. Furthermore, operators differ in their skill and ability to use the scope. Consequently, it seems logical to use the operators as blocks. Four operators are randomly selected.

```{r}

intensity=c(90,102,114,86,87,93,96,106,112,84,90,91,100,105,108,92,97,95,92,96,98,81,80,83)

Noise= gl(n = 3,k=1,length = 24,labels = (1:3))
Noise

Fil=gl(n = 2,k=3,length = 24,labels = (1:2))

Op=gl(n = 4,k=6,length = 24,labels = (1:4))

av=aov(intensity ~ Noise * Fil + Op)


summary(av)

# Random Effect
library(lme4)
avRE <- lmer(intensity ~ (1 | Op) +Noise*Fil)
summary(avRE)
# Confidence Intervals Variance Components and Overall Mean
confint(avRE,oldNames=FALSE)



```
