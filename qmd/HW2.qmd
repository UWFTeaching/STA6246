## Problem 1

A product developer is investigating the **tensile strength** of a new synthetic fiber that will be used to make cloth for men's shirts. Strength is usually affected by **the percentage of cotton** used in the blend of materials for the fiber. The engineer conducts a completely randomized experiment with five levels of cotton content and replicates the experiment five times. The data are shown in the following table.

```{=html}
<pre>
Cotton Weight Percent             Observations
15                                7 7 15 11 9
20                                12 17 12 18 18
25                                14 19 19 18 18
30                                19 25 22 19 23
35                                7 10 11 15 11
</pre>
```
1.  Enter the data in R so it is appropriately used to run ANOVA.

```{r}
# code here

```

2.  Is there evidence to support the claim that cotton content affects the mean tensile strength? Use α = 0.05.
    -   State the Hypotheses:

    -   Provide the ANOVA Table:

```{r}
# code here
```

3.  Use the Fisher LSD method to make comparisons between the pairs of means. What conclusions can you draw?

```{r}
# code here
```

4.  Analyze the residuals from this experiment and comment on model adequacy.

```{r}
# code here
```

## Problem 2

A manufacturer suspects that the batches of raw material furnished by his supplier differ significantly in calcium content. There are a large number of batches currently in the warehouse. Five of these are randomly selected for study. A chemist makes five determinations on each batch and obtains the following data:

![](images/batches.png){width="440"}

1.  Enter the data in R so it is appropriately used to run ANOVA.

```{r}
# code here

```

2.  Is this a random effects model? Why?
3.  Is there significant variation in calcium content from batch to batch? Use α = 0.05.
    -   State the Hypotheses.

    -   Provide the ANOVA Table.

```{r}
# code here
```

4.  Estimate the variance components for this model: $\sigma_\tau^2$ and $\sigma^2$.

```{r}
# code here
```

3.  Find a 95% Confidence Interval for ICC $\sigma_\tau^2/(\sigma_\tau^2 + \sigma^2)$ and give an **interpretation** of the ICC.

```{r}
# code here
```
