```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem A
This is data about gestation age and weights. We want to model the weights vs. age:
$$ weights_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 age_i + \varepsilon_i$$



```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(GLMsData)
data("gestation")
summary(gestation)

```

Comments...

```{r}
plot( Weight ~ Age, data=gestation, las=1, pch=ifelse( Births<50, 1, 19),
      xlab="Gestational age (weeks)", ylab="Mean birthweight (kg)",
      xlim=c(20, 45), ylim=c(0, 4))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
wlm=lm(Weight ~ Age, data=gestation,weights = Births)
summary(wlm)
```
