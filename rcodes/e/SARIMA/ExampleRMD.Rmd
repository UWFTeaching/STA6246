## EXAMPLE
The equation of the *Deaths* ,$X_t$,  data:


```{r}
plot.ts(deaths)
```


```{r}
bestmodel= auto.arima(deaths-mean(deaths),trace = F)
test(bestmodel$residuals)
bestmodel
```

The residuals based on the ```auto.arima()``` function are not IID.

We can eliminate the trend and seasonality and find out potential values for p, q, P, and Q.

```{r}
fit = arima(deaths-mean(deaths),order= c(0,1,0),seasonal = list(order = c(1, 1, 1), period = 12))

test(fit$residuals)
fit
confint(fit)
```

The equation:

$$
(1-0.28B^{12})(1-B)(1-B^{12})(deaths-8787.736) = (1-0.999B^{12})Z_t
$$
